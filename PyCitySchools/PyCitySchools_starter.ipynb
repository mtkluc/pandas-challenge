    "-----\n",
    "Of the schools analysed, most students are passing reading and maths.\n",
    "The best schools are typically independent schools and the lowest rank schools are typically Government schools.\n",
    "Bailey High - is an outlier as it is a high performing Government School, whereas, WIlson High is an underperforming independent school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within most schools the level of maths and reading performance remained the same throughout the year levels. The exception is Holden High, where the year 10 math's results appear to be a minor outlier in performance. The reasons remain unclear, possibly it could relate to the students - are they coming in from other schools or overseas; it could relate to a particular teacher or department - i.e. a particularly strong teaching group for that cohort, or it could be an outlier without any cause. Further analysis should be undertaken to review this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this districts schools, the spending efficiency was quite high with more students passing maths and reading with lower spends.\n",
    "Expenditure of $585-630/child appeared to correlate with the best outcomes.\n",
    "Within the district smaller schools performed better for reading and maths than larger schools.\n",
